# zenodup
These files were developed to automatically upload abstracts from DHd conferences to Zenodo including their metadata. 
The abstracts exist as TEI and first have to be modified with the 1_delete_attribute file before their metadata can be extracted with the 2_Metadata file. In 2016, the conference abstracts had a slightly different structure and the keywords can be extracted accurately with the file 2_Metadata_2016.
